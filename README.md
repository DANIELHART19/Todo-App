# TodoAppV3

This is my first project done using angular and typeScript.


You can add a new Todo.

Edit a todo by clicking it title which will redirect you to the editing component.

Delete the todo.

It uses an In-memory Web API Module to store, add, edit and delete the todos.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
